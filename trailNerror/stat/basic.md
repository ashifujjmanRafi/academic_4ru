In Machine Learning (and in mathematics) there are often three values that interests us:
Mean - The average value
Median - The mid point value
Mode - The most common value

Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.
A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.
A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.

Varience :
To calculate the variance you have to do as follows:

1. Find the mean:(32+111+138+28+59+77+97) / 7 = 77.4
2. For each value: find the difference from the mean:32 - 77.4 = -45.4
3. For each difference: find the square value:(-45.4)2 = 2061.16
4. The variance is the average number of these squared differences:(2061.16+1128.96+3672.36+2440.36+338.56+0.16+384.16) / 7 = 1432.2
